# Changelog

All notable changes to the SEO Expert skill are documented here.

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-13

One-line install via `npx`. Same skill content as 0.1.0; new way to deliver it.

### Added
- `package.json` — npm package metadata. Published as `@milandev98/seo-expert` to the public registry.
- `bin/seo-expert.js` — zero-dependency Node CLI. Drives:
  - `npx @milandev98/seo-expert install <tool>` for file-based installs (Cursor, Cline, Windsurf, Aider, continue.dev, Claude Code)
  - `npx @milandev98/seo-expert copy <tool>` for clipboard-based installs (ChatGPT, Claude Project, Gemini, Perplexity)
  - `npx @milandev98/seo-expert` for the interactive picker
  - `list`, `info`, `help` subcommands for discovery
- Existing-file backup on install — any pre-existing `.cursorrules` / `CONVENTIONS.md` / `.clinerules` is renamed to `<file>.bak.<timestamp>` before being overwritten.
- Cross-platform clipboard support (macOS `pbcopy`, Linux `wl-copy`/`xclip`/`xsel`, Windows `clip`) with a `seo-expert-adapter.md` file fallback when none is available.

### Changed
- `README.md` rewritten as a one-stop install guide with table of contents, npx primary path, and inline manual paths per AI tool.
- `INSTALL.md` adds a "Quickest path — one-line npx" section at the top and corrects the manual Claude Code clone path to `~/.claude/skills/seo-expert`.
- Skill content under `core/`, `adapters/`, `prompts/`, `sources/`, and `SKILL.md` is unchanged from v0.1.0 — `npx @milandev98/seo-expert@0.1.0` and `@0.2.0` ship identical guidance.

### Requirements
- Node ≥ 18 for the `npx` flow (zero deps, uses only `node:` built-ins).
- Manual install paths require no runtime — just file copy.

### Principles enforced by all adapters
- Answer-first structure
- Entities over keywords
- Extractability (H2/H3 questions, short paragraphs, tables, FAQ blocks)
- Source-backed claims
- AI visibility separated from traditional ranking
- Conversion outcomes over vanity metrics
- Diagnose before prescribing
- Verify, then ship

### Guardrails
- No bought reviews · no faked engagement · no link farms · no hidden text · no doorway pages · no generated-content spam · no keyword stuffing · no schema mismatched with visible content · no reproduction of raw third-party transcripts
